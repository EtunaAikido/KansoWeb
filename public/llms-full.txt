# Eskilstuna Ki-Aikido

> Aikido club in Eskilstuna, Sweden, established 1991. Training for children (7-11), youth (12-15) and adults (15+).

## About

Eskilstuna Ki-Aikido is a Swedish aikido club founded in 1991. We practice Ki-Aikido, a style that emphasizes the coordination of mind and body. The guiding principle is "keep one point" — maintaining calm regardless of what happens around you.

Aikido is a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba (1883-1969). The name means "the way to harmony with ki" — the universal life energy. Unlike other martial arts, aikido focuses not on defeating the opponent, but on neutralizing aggression and creating harmony. We train together, not against each other.

## Training Groups

### Children (Barn) — Ages 7-11
Play is mixed with aikido techniques and exercises that strengthen motor skills, balance and coordination. Children learn to fall safely and roll smoothly, while developing concentration and respect for each other.

### Youth (Ungdomar) — Ages 12-15
Training builds discipline, strengthened self-confidence and the ability to work together toward the same goal. Youth are challenged with more advanced techniques and gain tools for handling stress and conflicts in everyday life.

### Adults (Vuxna) — Ages 15+
Develop flexibility, balance and inner calm. Aikido provides tools for handling conflict situations without violence, while training the whole body. Suitable for everyone regardless of previous martial arts experience.
